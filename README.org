#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cabal sandbox init
  cabal install --only-dep

/It may be necessary to use `--allow-newer` to build the package./

This repository is a fork of
[[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/http-client-auth][http-client-auth-0.1.0.0]]
which has been updated to work with latest GHC and supporting
libraries.

I have modified the `qop` message in the digest auth request which has
fixed a bug in my own use cases. See commit a8d542cf.
